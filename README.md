## Simpe Ionic camera app which uses Cordova and Angular to build a mobile app

 Made using [Ionic 3](https://ionicframework.com/) -which itself uses [Angular 5](https://angular.io/) to help create functional web views and [Cordova 7](https://cordova.apache.org/) to emulate Android and iOS hardware-, [NodeJS 8](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Visual Studio Code 1](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 
 Code is lossely based on the tutorial [How to Create a Camera App With Ionic 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-camera-app-with-ionic-2--cms-28205)  
 The code was updated to work with Ionic 3.
